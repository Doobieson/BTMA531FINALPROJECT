Dataset not included but can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupindersinghrana/airbnb-price-dataset

Final group project where we decided to explore Airbnb pricing data. We started off with some EDA, then created a regression tree, k-means clusters, regression trees, and finally did dome text analytics of the listings. All of our findings are concluded in either the paper or presentation.
